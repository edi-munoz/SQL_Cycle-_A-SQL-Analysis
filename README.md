# Cycle in SQL: An analysis of bike-sharing data 
## [Data cleaning and analysis through SQL]
### Introduction 
This repository contains another end-of-course case study from Coursera's "Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate." This time around, I am put into a scenario of working as a junior data analyst as Cyclistic, a bike-sharing company based in Chicago. The company wants to know how casual riders and annual members differ, as well as how to convert casual riders into annual members.

### Ask 
The director of marketing, Lily Moreno has tasked me with the following question:

- How do casual riders and annual riders differ?

Mrs. Moreno and involved stakeholers believe the company's future lies in increasing annual memberships.
